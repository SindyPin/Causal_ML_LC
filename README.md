## üß≠ Project Overview & Methodology

> Long COVID (Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19) affects 10-40% of COVID-19 survivors, yet current diagnostic approaches rely on symptom presentation, precluding early intervention opportunities.

### üîé Key Innovations
- **Causal feature selection framework** that transforms mechanistic gene discovery into actionable ML features
- **Pre-symptomatic risk stratification** using molecular signatures before clinical manifestation
- **Integration of three causal inference methods**: Transcriptome-Wide Mendelian Randomization (TWMR), Control Theory (CT), and Differential Causal Effects (DCE)
- **Systematic evaluation across 16 ML models** including foundation model TabPFN
- **Biologically interpretable predictions** with each feature linked to explicit causal hypotheses

### üéØ Our Approach
- Generate multiple causally-informed feature sets capturing distinct disease mechanisms
- Compare causal vs. variance-based feature selection across diverse ML architectures
- Demonstrate superior performance of compact causal panels (100-gene optimal)
- Validate biological relevance through literature curation (97/427 genes confirmed)
- Enable molecular-based risk assessment shifting from reactive to proactive care

## üìä Key Results

- **Causal features outperform traditional selection**: 1.4% precision improvement, 3.7% ROC-AUC improvement
- **500CTG subset achieves best performance**: Precision 0.678, ROC-AUC 0.631
- **TabPFN shows exceptional responsiveness** to causal features with 100-gene DCEG-Pathways achieving F1 0.760
- **Literature validation**: 22.7% of prioritized causal genes have established Long COVID roles

2. **Long COVID GWAS** (Lammi et al. 2023): 3,018 cases, 1,093,995 controls
3. **Mount Sinai RNA-seq** (GSE215865): 1,392 transcriptomic profiles
4. **Human PPI networks** (Vinayagam et al. 2011): Network backbone for CT
5. **KEGG pathways**: 348 human pathways for DCE analysis
